## üîç How It Works 

### üß† Expert Code Architecture & Flow

This project adheres to a layered, modular design that separates concerns between UI, processing logic, and I/O operations. It‚Äôs structured for maintainability and extensibility ‚Äî with the following architectural components:

---

### üìê Architecture Layers

| Layer           | Description                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI Layer**    | `DataCleanerGUI` class encapsulates the GUI logic using Tkinter and ttk.     |
| **Logic Layer** | Stateless, functional utilities for parsing, validating, comparing, writing. |
| **I/O Layer**   | File encoding, folder creation, and safe read/write operations.              |

---

### üß∞ GUI System Design (`DataCleanerGUI`)

The entire graphical interface is managed via `DataCleanerGUI`, a class that encapsulates the lifecycle of the Tkinter window.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Initializes themed layout using `ttkthemes.vista`.
* Renders sections: header, file inputs, results, footer.
* Hooks action buttons (e.g., Browse, Validate, Save) to corresponding back-end logic.
* Uses custom controls:

  * `ButtonWithIcon` for consistent styling + embedded base64 icons.
  * `Toast` for non-blocking feedback.
  * `ToolTip` for enhanced UX.
  * `LoadingSpinner` to indicate asynchronous work.

**Design Patterns Used:**

* Inversion of Control: Backend functions are injected into GUI handlers.
* MV-ish Pattern: Although not a full MVVM, logic and view are clearly decoupled.

---

### üß™ Backend Logic Breakdown

All core business logic is abstracted into stateless functions ‚Äî making them independently testable.

#### üîπ `read_data_file(file_path)`

Handles robust multi-encoding loading using pandas.

* Auto-detects encoding (UTF-8, Windows-1252, Latin1, UTF-16).
* Validates structure: exact 11-column, semicolon-delimited format.
* Verifies uniqueness of `SSS_Number`.
* Cleans strings, strips invisible characters, validates `Amount`.

> ‚ö† Returns `None` on parse failure to allow graceful upstream error handling.

#### üîπ `compare_dataframes(raw_df, upload_df)`

Performs vectorized diffing on all aligned fields (except `Amount`):

* Uses `pandas.merge()` to align based on `SSS_Number`.
* Extracts:

  * Row-level mismatches
  * Records missing from upload
  * Extra records in upload

Output: A structured diff for downstream reporting and correction.

#### üîπ `clean_upload_file(...)`

Cleans the upload file by enforcing schema parity:

* Filters out extra SSS Numbers.
* Retains original `Amount` values from the upload.
* Overwrites remaining fields with values from the raw file.
* Auto-generates a versioned filename (e.g., `*_cleaned_v2.txt`).

#### üîπ `save_mismatch_report(...)`

Logs all mismatch metadata into a timestamped CSV file.

* Categorizes records: Mismatch / Missing / Extra.
* Uses `pandas.concat` to unify them into one exportable frame.
* Versioned to prevent accidental overwrite of previous audits.

#### üîπ `main(...)`

Single-entry orchestration function.

Flow:

```
read ‚Üí compare ‚Üí clean ‚Üí save report ‚Üí log
```

Also used by the GUI layer via function injection to `print()` ‚Äî redirecting output into a Tkinter Text widget for real-time feedback.

#### üîπ `ensure_app_folders()`

\[PLACEHOLDER: DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION FOR SSS DATA CLEANER]

This Python code defines a GUI application for cleaning and validating SSS (Social Security System) data files. It's structured as a desktop application using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface, pandas for data manipulation, and pathlib and os for file system operations.

---

---

\[END PLACEHOLDER - Insert Real Implementation/Code Here as Needed]


Ensures directory safety for:

* `OUTPUT/`: Cleaned files
* `REPORT/`: Audit files

Supports both CLI and PyInstaller bundle contexts via `sys._MEIPASS` & `__file__`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Modes

* **Script Mode**: Executed via `python HRA.py`, using local paths.
* **Bundled Mode**: Supports PyInstaller packaging via frozen executable check (`sys.frozen`).

---

### üîÑ Extensibility Notes

The codebase is intentionally built with extensibility in mind:

* **Themed UI**: Swappable with other `ttkthemes` without code changes.
* **Validation Logic**: Modular ‚Äî easy to add additional column rules or reporting.
* **Localization-Ready**: Encodings, tooltips, and labels are centralized.
* **Testability**: All core logic is function-based and decoupled from GUI state.

---

### ‚ú® GUI Class Breakdown: `DataCleanerGUI`

This class wraps the Tkinter root window and manages layout and event handling.

Key components:

* `__init__()` initializes layout, style, and binds buttons.
* `_create_widgets()` arranges all UI components using a structured layout: header, file selectors, options, results, and footer.
* `_process_files()` is the handler for the "Validate & Clean" button ‚Äî it invokes the entire backend pipeline.

Subcomponents:

* `ButtonWithIcon`: Custom Tkinter Button with base64 icon embedding.
* `ToolTip`: Tooltip implementation on hover.
* `Toast`: Non-blocking notification system.
* `LoadingSpinner`: Canvas-based loading animation.

---

### üìÇ Core Functional Blocks

#### `read_data_file(file_path)`

Purpose: Load SSS text/CSV file with flexible encoding fallback and validate column structure.

Highlights:

* Tries encodings in order: `utf-8`, `cp1252`, `latin1`, `utf-16`.
* Parses data into DataFrame with strict column names.
* Checks for:

  * Invalid numeric `Amount`
  * Duplicate `SSS_Number`

#### `compare_dataframes(raw_df, upload_df)`

Purpose: Detect mismatches and differences in aligned SSS rows.

Logic:

* Uses vectorized `pandas.merge()` with suffixes.
* Iterates over all columns except `SSS_Number` to compare values.
* Outputs:

  * `mismatch_report`: field-wise value differences
  * `missing_records`: raw entries not in upload
  * `extra_records`: upload entries not in raw

#### `clean_upload_file(raw_df, upload_df, extra_records, output_path)`

Purpose: Clean the upload file by removing non-matching records and syncing raw values.

* Removes all rows in upload that don't exist in raw.
* Overwrites all columns with raw data **except** `Amount`.
* Saves cleaned file to versioned path inside `OUTPUT/`.

#### `save_mismatch_report(...)`

Purpose: Combine all mismatch/missing/extra data into a CSV report.

* Adds a timestamp to filename.
* Combines three report types into one DataFrame.
* Saves to `REPORT/mismatch_report_<timestamp>.csv`

#### `main(...)`

Orchestration entrypoint for headless batch execution.

Steps:

1. Loads both files.
2. Calls `compare_dataframes`.
3. Cleans file using `clean_upload_file`.
4. Saves report using `save_mismatch_report`.
5. Logs stats and results to terminal (or GUI via overridden `print`).

#### `ensure_app_folders()`

Ensures `OUTPUT/` and `REPORT/` directories are present in runtime directory.
Used before file writing in both script and EXE mode.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Application Modes

* **Development Mode**: Runs via Python, paths resolved with `__file__`.
* **EXE Bundle Mode**: Uses `sys._MEIPASS` for bundled resource access (PyInstaller-compatible).
